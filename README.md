## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction

OKP4 aims to enable a new generation of applications using blockchain as an orchestration layer for shared off-chain resources, such as datasets, algorithms, software, and computation. This repository provides an efficient and user-friendly environment for onboarding and interacting with the OKP4 blockchain.

## ‚ö° Getting Started with Just One Click

Before you begin, ensure you have a [Gitpod account](https://gitpod.io/). If it's your first time using Gitpod, you'll need to connect your GitHub account to your Gitpod account. Follow the prompts during the initial launch to set this up.
